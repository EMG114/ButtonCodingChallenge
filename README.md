## Button Coding Challenge:

Write a function that takes an aritmetic expression as a string and returns its value.

Example Test Case
"+ 1 + 2 3" returns 6

## Requirements
This was written in Xcode, Apple's IDE. Use the latest version of Xcode and test in Playground.
Written in Swift 4.0

## Installation
Download this project and run using the latest version of Xcode (Playground).

## Technical Highlights
* Xcode 9
* Written Swift 4
* iOS 11

## Description

The general rules given:

Expressions can be numbers or operator expressions (4 is an expression and so is - 3 1)
Numbers evaluate to themselves (4 is 4)
Operator expressions evaluate to an arithmetic computation of the two following sub-expressions. Which arithmetic computation we make is determined by the first token in the operator expression. The syntax is always <Operator> <Expression> <Expression>, so in + 1 2, + is the operator and 1 and 2 are the expressions to sum.
The two operator types we'll support are + a b (evaluated as a + b) and - (evaluated as a - b)
