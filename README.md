## Button Challenge:
Calculate a string expression by creating a function

Example Test Case:

"+ 1 + 2 3" returns 6


## Requirements
Recent version of Xcode
Language: Swift 4.0

## Installation
Download this project and run using the latest version of Xcode and Swift.


## Description

The general rules for thsi challenge are:

Expressions can be numbers or operator expressions (4 is an expression and so is - 3 1)
Numbers evaluate to themselves (4 is 4)
Operator expressions evaluate to an arithmetic computation of the two following sub-expressions. Which arithmetic computation we make is determined by the first token in the operator expression. The syntax is always <Operator> <Expression> <Expression>, so in + 1 2, + is the operator and 1 and 2 are the expressions to sum.
The two operator types we'll support are + a b (evaluated as a + b) and - (evaluated as a - b)
